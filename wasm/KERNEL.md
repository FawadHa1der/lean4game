# Kernel dependency

The wasm64 Lean kernel this game runs on lives at
**github.com/FawadHa1der/lean4, branch `qed64-wasm64`**
(local checkout: `~/code/wasm64-lean-kernel`). It builds with
`wasm64-build/build.sh` there; this repo consumes its OUTPUTS:

- runtime chunks in `client/public/runtime/` (chunked by qed64's
  `chunk-runtime.mjs` from the kernel's stage1),
- game environment snapshots in `client/public/snapshots/` (baked by qed64's
  `bake-snapshot.mjs` against the SAME stage1 — snapshots are binary-paired
  to the exact runtime; never mix builds),
- the fork's native `stage0/bin/{lean,lake}` (via Docker) to compile
  GameServer and game packages (`wasm/scripts/compile-pkg.py`).

Current pin: kernel commit `852d1b9c3a` (series HEAD 2d75ec1 + build layer),
runtime `wasm64-303e5c765fc415ed`. The qed64 repo's
`pipeline/toolchain/KERNEL-PIN` is the machine-readable pin, including the
paired snapshot identities.

## Substrate pin (the qed64 closure, vendored)

The browser-side substrate — boot (`qed64-boot.ts`), watchdog shim, runtime
client, snapshot loader, install profiles, and the two worker scripts — is a
**vendored copy of the qed64 closure at one commit**, under
`client/src/wasm/vendor/qed64/` with the pin in
`client/src/wasm/vendor/QED64-PIN`. The `qed64/...` import specifiers resolve
there (vite alias + tsconfig paths); `scripts/stage-game-assets.sh` copies the
worker scripts from the same directory, so shim and worker are paired by
construction. Nothing in a build reads the qed64 checkout any more.

It used to be a live `file:` link into the qed64 checkout: every build
compiled whatever that checkout held at that second, uncommitted edits
included (a half-typed import broke the game build on 2026-09-02, and shim
behaviour changed under a running test day), and the worker copy could
silently drift from the shim.

Bump: `scripts/sync-qed64.sh <qed64-commit>` (extracts with `git archive`,
never from a working tree), rebuild, run cypress, commit the diff. The
closure has no third-party imports; the sync script fails if a relative
import does not resolve inside the vendored tree.

## Snapshot rebake 2026-09-02 (GameServer `Runner` hoist, runtime unchanged)

`server/GameServer/Runner.lean` now loads the level's JSON once per
elaboration instead of once per syntax node (`findForbiddenTactics` took
`loadLevelData` — ~46 ms of JSON parsing under wasm64 — on every node, so a
proof's check cost ≈ 0.3 s + 46 ms × nodes: 8 s for an 8-step proof).
Measured on the headless probe: 8-step proof 8.1 s → 0.73 s; flat in proof
length. Only `GameServer/Runner.olean` changed (21 other modules rebuilt
byte-identical); no game package references it, so no game olean moved.

Rebake lane (no stage1 involvement — qed64's `work/build/stage1` currently
holds the unpaired 0031 experiment): reassemble the pinned runtime from
`client/public/runtime/chunks` (sha256-verified, `wasm64-303e5c765fc415ed`)
into an artifact dir with `bin/lean.{js,wasm}`, then
`bake-snapshot.mjs --artifact <that dir> --lib work/lib-tree-{nng4,testgame}`
with the usual probe (`import Game`, `import GameServer.Runner`, `#check`).
Stage with `scripts/stage-snapshots.py <staging dir> nng4 testgame` (copies
the digest-named `.snapz`, merges `index.json`, removes the superseded
files), then rebuild the client.
